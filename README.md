# Sleeping-Habits-Web-App

**Project Introduction**
Being someone who has a pretty bad sleep schedule and almost always stays up too late, I wanted to make something that could adhere to my needs when I'm often on my computer late at night. I also wanted to learn more about developing web apps and other UI related projects. This project is a web app built on the Rust crates Yew and Rocket. It displays information and various notifications / reminders based on the time the user typically sleeps, giving options for users to get the amount of sleep they'll want. The app will hopefully be able to additionally perform operations to the user's needs such as dimming the screen's brightness or adding warmer colors to the display. 

**System Overview**
Build a working web app that can be displayed on your browser, with simple buttons and other features for testing. 

Add useful features for users, including an option to enter in when they usually sleep, the time they want to wake up, or the amount of hours of sleep they want. 

Add a feature where notifications / reminders will be displayed on the screen to the user. 

Build a nice UI using different styles

Add a feature where screen brightness and colors change based on the time

**Possible Challenges**
I don't have much experience with building apps and user interfaces, so making a vibrant web app will be difficult. Keeping a timer or clock running on the web app may take some work. I'm also not entirely sure if and how system settings like screen brightness can change due to a web app.
